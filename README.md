The Web API was made without the ASP.NET Core Identity using custom JWT middleware

- Refresh token rotation
- Revoked token reuse detection
- Email sign up and verification

- Role based authorization with two roles "User" and "Admin"
- CRUD Account management routes with role based access control

# Tech used for this Web Client

- Node.js version 20
- Volta for Node Version management
- Angular 14 is the JS framework for this frontend
- TypeScript
- Jasmin for Unit Testing
- Karma for configuration and HTML Test report coverage
- GH Pages for hosting
- VS Code is my developement tool

# Tech used for Web API, DB, Hosting and DevOps

- .NET 8
- MS SQL for the DB
- Azure App Service for Hosting
- DevOps by Azure Repos and Pipelines
- CORS Policy with Credentials set to true
- Azure Data Studio for DB Management
- VS Code as developement tool
- Swagger API documentation with routes

# Architectural / Design pattern

- MVC architectural / design pattern which separates the App into logical components 

# Installing the Angular Client

- Make sure you have a new version of Node installed
- Download the code by zip or fork
- Run the command npm install by the command promt

# Development server:

- npm run start

- You can view the development server at `localhost:4200`

# Production build:

- npm run build

The production build will be in the folder: dist

# Testing

- npm run test

Testing with Karma and Jasmine

Test example 1 - src/test.example.spec

Test example 2 - src/app/test.example.spec

Note: Testing was not working with Angular 15 !

Maybe could be solved adding a test.spec.ts
